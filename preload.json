Examinations revealed features of miliary tuberculosis and granuloma suggestive of mycobacterial infection. Anti-tuberculosis treatment resulted in a remarkable improvement in his symptoms and gradually upgrading of radiological appearance. The symptoms were less severe than some others described but this case provides evidence that, even in some cases, specific treatment may be necessary. We highlight the importance of recognizing miliary Mycobacterium bovis as a probable complication of bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy.

In the hospital admission, physical examination showed tachycardia, hepatomegaly, bipalpebral edema and anasarca. Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes were found in microscopy during blood cell count. Twenty-three days before hospitalization, the child had ingested the \"bacaba palm fruit's wine\". Even with the appropriate diagnosis and starting of treatment, she did not survive. Quantitative analysis of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in a blood sample resulted in 54,053.42 parasite equivalents/mL and the DTU TcIV was identified. The outcome may have been determined by several factors, including the delay to seek a medical service beyond the high parasitemia, detected by qPCR.
